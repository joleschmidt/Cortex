## Notes

1. Make the app function as a Second Brain:
   The user can simply save content, and it will be stored for future reference.

2. AI-First Data Design:
   Ensure all data is AI-ready, with structured storage to enable seamless future integration with AI chat or assistants. The ultimate goal is to provide the user with a comprehensive archive of their life that AI can access to understand preferences, thinking patterns, and personal needs.  
   - Privacy is a key priority.

3. Voice Notes Integration: 
   Incorporate meeting notes and voice recordings, allowing users to save and organize audio content in Cortex.
