# AI-First Data Design Rules

## Always Design for AI Consumption
- Store and handle all data with AI processing in mind as a primary consideration
- Data structures, schemas, and formats should be optimized for AI readability and processing

## Data Storage Principles
- **Structured over unstructured**: Prefer structured data formats (JSON, relational schemas) over unstructured text when possible
- **Explicit metadata**: Always include metadata fields (content_type, extracted_data, timestamps, source) to help AI understand context
- **Normalized formats**: Use consistent, normalized data formats across the system
- **Type information**: Include type information in schemas and data structures

## Data Handling Best Practices
- **Clean extraction**: Extract and store data in clean, parseable formats
- **Preserve context**: Store contextual information alongside data (URLs, timestamps, source identifiers)
- **Avoid encoding issues**: Use UTF-8, avoid binary blobs when text alternatives exist
- **Queryable structure**: Design schemas that enable efficient AI queries and filtering
- **Versioning**: Consider versioning for data schemas to track changes over time

## AI-Friendly Data Patterns
- Store extracted text content separately from raw HTML/PDF when possible
- Include both raw and processed/cleaned versions of data when useful
- Use descriptive field names that clearly indicate content and purpose
- Avoid nested structures that are difficult for AI to parse (prefer flat structures with clear relationships)
- Include semantic markers (tags, categories, classifications) to aid AI understanding
