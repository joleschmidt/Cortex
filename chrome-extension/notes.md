1. make the app functioning as a second brain - the user can just save something and we store it 
2. the goal is to make the data ai-ready so late we could integrate it easily with an ai chat for example
 -> the later goal is that the user has an archive of his life and can access it via ai and knows how the user thinks and what the user wants
 ! privacy is key here
